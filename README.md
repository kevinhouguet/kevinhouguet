# :wave: Hi There !

I'm Kevin, a passionate and voracious back-end developer of new technology.

I'm leaving a 800 hours formation of web development. Name is O'Clock. I recommend all in-doubt people in IT programation to go in this French remote school.

So, i have been learning the web development in this school with technology and language like :
- html / css
- :rocket: javascript / nodeJS
- Bundler : ViteJS
- raw SQL (DDL, DML), ORM : Sequelize, Datamapper, ActiveRecord
- DB : postgresql, mongoDB
- DBMS : Sqitch
- Make API, secure, document it and rendering.
- Consume API with AJAX method.
- Deploy the project on VM and on a PaaS.
- Back app architecture : MVC
- Advanced SQL : index, function, loop
- GraphQL
- Discover of IA, Learning machine
- Project method : agile with User Stories, Wireframes, GitHub Project, Kanban, Issues, Sprint, Pull-Request

I'm particulary enthousiast with nodeJS and API creativity potential :heart:

I'm also an autodidacte in development. I have learned and practice since 10 years some language like PHP, Python, Java and Framework like Angular. But i lacked of bases so i take a school to teach me fundation of development.

I'm actually looking for a job, so if my profile and my work enjoy to you do not hesitate to contact me.

# You can catch me here !
